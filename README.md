# Pyrhon3-projects
For ANY Python 3.9 projects. 

{
My first project is a Compiler for:
  C (IDK, its just smaller, i guess)
  C++ (just as widely used as C++, i like C++ better than c, but im going to learn both)
  Batch (yep, i have a converter for it)
  Java (don't worry, its going to be converted to c++, then processed for syntax, then compiled to binary:
            but only up to 100 lines because the free converter only does up to 100 lines)
  Typescript (goes into javascript)
  
  -will have a GUI without being forced to use and IDE
  -will compile up to 8 files at once, but for testing puposes, only four.
  -will use threading module for multi compiling
}
